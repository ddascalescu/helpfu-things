Place in folder with the minecraft launcher.exe used by the FTB app.

Batch file swaps the custom JSON file (containing the desired instance) for the existing launcher_profiles.json and starts the launcher.

Start .vbs file to start the batch file invisibly.

Change names of files (and references in the .bat and .vbs) accordingly, and insert the desired instance references in the JSON file --- use the existing pre-generated launcher_profiles.json when the desired instance is loaded through the FTB app.
