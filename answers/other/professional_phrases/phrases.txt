I'm not accepting that meeting because it's a waste of time.
	Declining this invite as I don't think my participation in this discussion is required.

I'm not working for free.
	Our current work agreement reflects a 40 hour work week. I understand there will be weeks where this number will fluctuate, but those circumstances are the exception as opposed to the rule. If the expectation moving forward is that I am to work over 40 hours per week, then I would be happy to review my contract and compensation to better reflect this change.

How many times do I need to tell you this?
	I encourage you to write down this information to refer back to in the future, instead of relying on me to communicate it again.

I can't keep doing the job of 4 people, so hire someone.
	Do you have a timeline of when we are planning to hire someone to assist with my workload? The number of responsibilities I have absorbed are not sustainable long-term and would benefit from some additional support.

That timeline is ridiculous. Why would you commit us to that?
	Thank you for sharing that timeline with me. Can you help me understand how this amount of work is achievable in such a short period of time?
