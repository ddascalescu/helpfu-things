# helpful-things
Random things that I can't find easily elsewhere, usually computing/programming topics. Mostly answers to common questions, solutions to software bugs, some code snippets or small scripts that I find useful.

Usually utilised by simply searching for my issue, if a prior internet search didn't have clear answers.

Essentially it is a personal knowledge base.
